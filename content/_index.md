I am currently doing a Bachelor's degree in Physics. My primary interests are mathematics, science, free software and rational analysis. I have previous training as data scientist, specifically in the subfield of machine learning engineering. From time to time I contribute to Wikipedia. If you want to get in touch, you can send me an [email](mailto:trigo@inventati.org) at me on [Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tunjan) or open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/tunjan).
