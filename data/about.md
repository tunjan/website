## Introduction

As obvious as it may be, this page aims to describe a few superficial things about myself. I may be referred to as Alberto, I was born in MÃ¡laga, Spain, though I identify myself more as an European rather than a Spaniard. That may be a factor in my decision to move to Poland, where I have been living since September, 2022. My main interests are physics, mathematics, science, rationality, and English. These topics are wide in scope, though it feels weird to name every subtopic in which I have interest, so they will not be listed.

I wish I could write a section to list my awards and achievements, though, because of their non-existance, I propose to give a rough sketch of how I have spent my last few years. I started a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, which I dropped after a couple of years because of disinterest, despite a good performance on introductory courses. Later on I started studying physics, which offered me a more pure (as in the goal of its study) and challenging enviroment, with subjectively better colleagues. A few months later I started doing a training in data science and teaching mathematics & physics to International Baccaulerate students.

That completes the rough sketch, I hope the reader can make more-or-less accurate inferences from it. Feel free to contact me in case you want to conversate.
