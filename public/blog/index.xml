      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Problem : A thick spherical shell carries charge density: $$\rho = \frac{k}{r^2} \quad (a \le r \le b)$$ Find the electric field in the following three regions: $$(i)\ r &lt; a \quad (ii)\ a &lt; r &lt; b \quad (iii)\ r &gt; b$$</p>
<p>Solution: It is the case that a spherical surface is symmetrical on any axis, therefore Gauss&rsquo; law will be used. $$\oint_{S} \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a}=\frac{Q_{\mathrm{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}$$</p>
<p>$(i)$ The density in this part of the sphere is $0$, therefore $Q_{\mathrm{enc}} = 0$ and the electric field $\vec{E} = 0$</p>
<p>$(ii)$ In this case, the only part that contributes to the electric field is the volume in the section $ (a &lt; r &lt; b) $. The dot product of the electric field vector with the surface vector is parallel and constant over the whole surface, therefore it can be rewritten as $$ \oint_{S} |{E}|\ d\vec{a} = |E| \oint_{S} d\vec{a} = |E|4\pi r^2$$</p>
<p>As for the total enclosed charge, it is obvious that $ \mathrm{d}q = \rho\ \mathrm{d}\tau$ and therefore $$ Q_{\mathrm{enc}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}} \int \rho\ \mathrm{d} \tau $$</p>
<p>Let us define the $ \mathrm{d}\tau $ factor in spherical coordinates as $$ d\tau = r^2 \sin {\theta}\ dr\ d\phi\ d\theta $$</p>
<p>Then $$ Q_{\mathrm{enc}} =  \int_{a}^{r} \frac{k}{r^2}\ r^2 \sin {\theta}\ dr\ d\phi\ d\theta = 4\pi k \int_{a}^{r} dr = 4\pi k  (r - a) \hat{r} $$</p>
<p>And the resulting equations is:</p>
<p>$$ |E|4\pi r^2 =  \frac{4\pi k}{\epsilon_{0}}  (r - a) \hat{r} $$</p>
<p>Which simplifies to:</p>
<p>$$ \vec{E}= \frac{k}{\epsilon_{0}} \left(\frac{r-a}{r^2}\right) \hat{r}.  \qquad \square$$</p>

      <title>First</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/first/</link>

      <description>As expected from my previous endeavors, I find myself reluctant to write this first post. In part, this reluctance stems from my awareness that I am not in the mindset for careful and deliberate writing. However, upon further introspection, I realize a stronger correlation to the feeling of self-judgment regarding my writing skills. In any case, my aim for these posts was not to provide the reader with exceptional value, but simply to hold myself accountable.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As expected from my previous endeavors, I find myself reluctant to write this first post. In part, this reluctance stems from my awareness that I am not in the mindset for careful and deliberate writing. However, upon further introspection, I realize a stronger correlation to the feeling of self-judgment regarding my writing skills. In any case, my aim for these posts was not to provide the reader with exceptional value, but simply to hold myself accountable.</p>
<p>I fail to remember what was I learning at the start of the week. Therefore, as a lesson, moving forward I will keep track of what I have been reading.
A significant portion of my time has been spent (or otherwise invested) in reading LessWrong posts. I have found in them inspiration and motivation to keep
improving my rationality toolkit. Sometimes it feels relieving to know that there are other fellow humans who value the same things as I do. One of the posts
particularly attracted my attention, it dealt with the topic of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yA8DWsHJeFZhDcQuo/the-talk-a-brief-explanation-of-sexual-dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> and how it fits within the evolution paradigm.</p>
<p>However, my daily shifts between subjects have been counterproductive. It feels as if the way of thinking did not get into my intuition because I have not spent enough continuous time thinking about it. As an example, I can remember that when I studied Newtonian physics and spent a great deal of time thinking during problem-solving, it got to the point where I was not
leaving my Newtonian hat at the faculty, but had it even until I reached home. And now, even after a few years I am able to put that hat again as needed. Whereas, with
probability, because I have studied it intermittently and not deeply enough, I have not developed the ability to wear the hat. I hope this analogy comes through to the reader.</p>
<p>Much of this week has also been spent learning MLOps, as I&rsquo;m pursuing a course in machine learning engineering. While not the most intellectually stimulating subject (as it focuses on using existing software rather than exploring fundamental science), it&rsquo;s a comfortable area for me due to my extensive GNU/Linux experience over the past four years.</p>
<p>Some ideas I have for next week&rsquo;s post are to upload some of the problems I have had most trouble solving or have found particularly amusing to work on.</p>
<p>Finally, I list some of the books I have been reading this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>A concise introduction to Logic</li>
<li>Designing Machine Learning Systems</li>
<li>Fundamentals Of Probability</li>
</ul>
